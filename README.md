## Media Stream Processing Application

This C application is a comprehensive solution for processing media streams, particularly focusing on demultiplexing, decoding, encoding, and multiplexing tasks. It employs a variety of libraries and tools to facilitate media stream manipulation and transformation.

### Main idea 

To fix the clock (PCR) - like PCR restamping

### Key Features

1. **Stream Handling**: Utilizes the `libupipe` framework for pipeline processing of media streams.
2. **Multiformat Support**: Capable of handling different media formats including MPEG, H.264, AC3, and others, using `upipe-modules` and `upipe-framers`.
3. **Demultiplexing**: Employs `upipe-ts` for demultiplexing Transport Stream (TS) files, supporting various codecs.
4. **Encoding and Decoding**: Integrates `upipe-av` for encoding and decoding using `libavcodec` (from FFmpeg).
5. **Media Synchronization**: Manages media synchronization and timing using `uclock`.
6. **Thread Management**: Utilizes `upipe-pthread` for efficient thread management in processing pipelines.
7. **Advanced Media Processing**: Supports operations like video trimming, blending, and format conversion.
8. **Network Streaming**: Capable of handling UDP-based media streams for both input (source) and output (sink).
9. **Conditional MPEG2/X262 Encoder Integration**: The application includes conditional compilation for MPEG2/X262 encoding.
10. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implements comprehensive error handling and verbose logging for effective debugging.

### Dependencies

- `libswscale`: For image scaling and format conversion.
- `libev`: A high-performance event loop/event model with lots of features.
- `libupipe`: A framework for pipeline processing of media streams.
- `FFmpeg`: A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.

### Configuration

- **Memory Management**: Uses `umem` for memory management with predefined pool sizes.
- **User Configuration**: Allows user-specified settings for various parameters like log level, input/output paths, CRF value for quality control, and remuxing option.

### Usage

Run the application with command-line arguments to specify the input and output stream paths, along with optional debug or verbose flags. 

The application supports a conditional remuxing feature which can be enabled via command-line arguments.
